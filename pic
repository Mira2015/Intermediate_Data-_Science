Hi John: 
Just wanted to give you a heads up, I have an upcoming dentist appointment (torture) next Tuesday 8:00-10:00. 
This time I will fully prepare mentally and physically.  I am planning to come to office after anesthetic goes away a little bit.  I will be in the office around noon or earlier.  Please let me know if is ok with you, I deeply appreciate your kindness.  I hope it will be my last time to visit dentist this year.
