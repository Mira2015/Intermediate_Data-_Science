Here is my first step to the research on cryptocurrency.  I am starting with the top sites of where to buy/sell cryptocurrency. 

After narrowing down from the top 14 sites to buy crypto, I did some further research to see what companies are being mentioned in higher frequency in articles and have narrowed the list down to the top 10 sites/platform.  From there, I used the following list of keywords to search merchant descriptions in the database.

  Coninbase  
  CoinMama
  CEX.IO
  Xcoins
  Cryptopia
  Paxful

I had some quick findings. 

•	I have identified two major crypto merchants in our database which are CoinBase and CoinMama, ConinBase was also on the list you gave me. 
•	I took a closer look at CoinBase and there are some interesting statistics.  CoinBase has significant POS transaction volume. In last December, CoinBase’s tran amt is close to PetSmart which ranks as the top 73 in our Dec report.
•	Coinbase shows dramatic growth since last October. 

  What’s next:

•	I will double verify CoinBase’s “TRAN_STMT_DESC” to ensure those merchant descriptions are really crypto merchants. 
•	I will also keep searching other possible high volume crypto merchants.
