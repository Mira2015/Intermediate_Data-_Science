Here is my first step findings. I start with top sites lists
to buy cryptocurrency. 

After narrow down from top 14 sites to buy crypto,
I did some further research and see what high frequencies company are being
mentioned on the articles and then narrow down to 10 sites/platform. I used the following list as keyword to search merchants
name in the database.

  Coninbase  
  CoinMama
  CEX.IO
  Xcoins
  Cryptopia
  Paxful

I had some interesting findings. 

-I have identified two major crypto
merchants in our database which are CoinBase and CoinMama. 

-I take a closer look at CoinBase,
there are interesting statistics, CoinBase has significant transaction volume.
In last December, CoinBase’s tran amt is close to PetSmart which rank as top 73
in our Dec report.

-Coinbase shows dramatic growth since last October. 

  What’s next :

I
will double verify the “TRAN_STMT_DESC” ensure they are really crypto
merchantsI will do some research about the company kraken
/Gemmini since they are also popular site to buy crypto. When I search in the
database, I found a lot key word with Kraken but mix with coffee shop so it need to further inspection.
